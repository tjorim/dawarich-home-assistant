> [!CAUTION]
> Home Assistant version 2025.1 will change to pydantic v2. If you decide to update HA you will have to update this integration to 0.3.2, which contains a patch for this. If you have any issues, please report them.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental integration for Dawarich, expect possibly breaking changes. This is a community integration, not affiliated with Dawarich.


[Dawarich](https://dawarich.app/) is a self-hosted Google Timeline alternative ([see](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) why you would want to consider it).

This integration does two things, of which one is optional.
1. It provides statistics for your account, this includes total distance in kilometers, number of cities visited etc.
2. (optional) You can set a device tracker (mobile phone for example) to send it's data through home assistant to Dawarich. That way you won't need another app, and can simply use the, probably already existing, location in HA.

## Install
There are two ways to install this. The easiest is with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).
